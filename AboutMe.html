									I am a Data Analytics Instructor and Professional Geoscientist with over 25 years of expertise in oil and gas exploration. Based in Calgary, Alberta, I am currently an instructor at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in the School for Advanced Digital Technology. My teaching responsibilities include courses on Predictive Modeling with IBM SPSS Modeler and R, Data Preparation and Modeling with SQL and Visual Studio, Statistical Analysis using Microsoft Excel and R, and Data Visualization with tools like Power BI, Tableau, and IBM Cognos. Some of my key skills include: problem-solving, critical thinking, and commitment to lifelong learning and helping others.
									
									My 25 year geoscience career includes: Equinor Canada, as a Principal Geoscientist, leading the seismic interpretation for the Bay du Nord offshore oil prospect, which led to several significant oil discoveries. I was a Technical Team Leader at Shell Canada, overseeing multidisciplinary teams in evaluating various Atlantic margin basins and mentoring new employees. Earlier roles include Senior Geoscientist at Anadarko Canada and Geoscientist at Mobil Canada, where I focused on prospect maturation and seismic stratigraphy. Jason holds a Post-Diploma Certificate in Data Analytics from SAIT and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Earth Sciences from Dalhousie University. I am a certified IBM Predictive Analytics Modeler and Business Intelligence Analyst.</p>
